        <h2>BACKGROUND VERIFICATION</h2>
        <p>Fudged CVs are common in today's corporate world, making it a challenge for hiring managers to ascertain the identity claims of the candidate being recruited.
            Whether their CV is authentic� their qualifications, work experiences and correspondence address stated are true�that they are not a spy sent by a competitor to
            steal sensitive company information, etc. The risks of hiring without proper background verification are too high for an organization, but are often ignored.
            India is on the economic boom and millions of dollars of business is outsourced to India. The companies are in tremendous pressure to hire in big numbers,
            due to this pressure many unsuccessful hires arise simultaneously and the HR managers spend a lot of their valuable time dealing with the repercussions of these unsuccessful hires.
            A solution to the above mentioned problem leads to the need for Employee Background Screening at Adamma.</p>
